# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13

# Print the result of 13 added to 22

# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22

# Print the result of 22 mutiplied by 13

# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)

# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13

# Print the reminder of 22 divided by 13

num1 = 13
num2= 22

print(num1 + num2)
print(num2 - num1)
print(num1 * num2)
print(num2 / num1)
print(num2 // num1)
print(num2 % num1)
